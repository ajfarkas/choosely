## Dev Watch
Client-side Javascript is written in es2016, and compiled using Webpack: 

  - `$ webpack --watch`

CSS is written using SASS, and compiled with the following command (make sure you're in the `choosely` repo folder)

  - `$ sass --watch ./sass:./public`

## Run Locally
In order to run this application on your local machine, you need both a Node and HTTP server running. A simple way to do the latter is with `http-server`.

  - `$ sudo npm install -g http-server`

Once that's done, you can run both servers from the main repo folder (`choosely/`), in two different Terminal windows: 

  - `$ node app`
  - `$ http-server -p 8008`

Then you can load the page in any browser by navigating to `http://localhost:8008`.

Note: you can quit either sever in Terminal by typing `ctrl-c`.
