There is one file missing, which contains the configuration details for emailing confirmations. This file is necessary to run the application, but must be added manually, with your own email details (you can't have mine):

**`node/config/smtp.js`**
````
module.exports = {
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'youremail@gmail.com',
    pass: 'nlkaldfpkonlkjbdfnbksjb'
  }
}
````

## Dev Watch
Client-side Javascript is written in es2016, and compiled using Webpack: 

  - `$ webpack --watch`

CSS is written using SASS, and compiled with the following command (make sure you're in the `choosely` repo folder)

  - `$ sass --watch ./sass:./public`

## Run Locally
In order to run this application on your local machine, you need the Node server running. You can do that from the main repo folder (`choosely/`), in a different Terminal window: 

  - `$ node app`

Then you can load the page in any browser by navigating to `http://localhost:8008`.

Note: you can quit the sever in Terminal by typing `ctrl-c`.
